Re-Enrollment 2026 - Nextgen Montessori

Dear {{ $parent->name }},

We thank you for being part of Nextgen Montessori in 2025. We are planning our rooms for 2026 and ask you to supply your preferred days.

Your enrollment is ongoing, so your current days in 2025, will be moved across for you for 2026. For example: if you attend Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday then these days will be automatically transferred across to 2026 for you.

Many parents choose to change their days in the new year, so if you wish to change or increase days, we ask that you advise now, so we can start planning.

ACTION REQUIRED: If you wish to change your child's enrollment in 2026, please complete the re-enrollment form:

IMPORTANT DEADLINE: Please return this form by 1st October 2025 to confirm your child's bookings for 2026.
